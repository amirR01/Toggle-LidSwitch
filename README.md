# Toggle-LidSwitch
The script is designed to toggle the configuration of Lid Switch between suspend and lock, and vice versa on linux.

# description
sometimes you want to only lock the screen when you close the lid, and sometimes you want to suspend the system. This script is designed to switch between these two configurations.

In my case, when I needed to ssh into my laptop, I wanted to lock the screen when I close the lid, so I decided to write this script.

# Usage
```bash
chmod +x toggleLidSwitch.sh
./toggleLidSwitch.sh
```
